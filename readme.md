# War Games
## a two player game
Monday night I thought this up
Creating this game to possibly be an email data collection engine
decided to make a very polarized topic "TRUMP vs. OBAMA"... easy emails


## Tech used
Disnt follow the videos due to the initial setup of the game. My game will have only one input for all players and will toggle turn.

While I was waiting on my son to finish his tennis xlass I hand wrote my code

Then I came home and grinded until 4am day 1

## Partially Working
On the Morning of Day 2
It's working and changing through all modals but not smoothly.
Felling great because it all works. Judt have to find the bugs...
